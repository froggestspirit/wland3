# `hardware.inc`
### Gameboy Hardware definitions
`hardware.inc` has been the standard include file containing Game Boy hardware definitions for use in [rgbds](https://github.com/rednex/rgbds) projects for over 20 years.

This repo is an attempt at version control. This is simply a kind of git mirror of the various flatfiles out there. I haven't written any of the actual code myself.

## Version history

The file was originally created by Jeff Frohwein in 1997, who still hosts [his latest version (2.3)](http://www.devrs.com/gb/files/hardware.zip) on his great [Dev'rs](http://devrs.com) website.

Although Jeff Frohwein tried to version control the file with a rudimentary change log at the top of the file, people have added small changes throughout the years, often without bumping the version number.

The most notable fork is by [@AntonioND](http://github.com/AntonioND), which is the one I've used as the mainline in this repo. Other forks will be added as branches, although I rarely know who made them.

* Jones (created the original `hardware.inc`, now lost)
* Carsten Sorenson (whose ideas Jeff based his file on)

* Probably lots of other people who have added to the file throughout the years
